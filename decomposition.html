  <h1>🌱 Decomposition</h1>

  <p><strong>Decomposition</strong> is the process of breaking down dead plants, animals, and organic matter into simpler substances.</p>

  <h2>🦠 Who Does It?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bacteria</strong> – tiny microbes that break down soft tissues</li>
    <li><strong>Fungi</strong> – such as mushrooms, help recycle nutrients</li>
    <li><strong>Invertebrates</strong> – like worms, insects, and beetles also assist</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧬 What Happens During Decomposition?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Carbon stored in dead organisms is released into the soil and air as CO₂ or methane</li>
    <li>Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are returned to the ecosystem</li>
    <li>This process enriches the soil and helps new plants grow</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌍 Why It Matters:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recycles carbon and other nutrients back into the ecosystem</li>
    <li>Prevents dead matter from piling up</li>
    <li>Supports soil health and plant growth</li>
  </ul>
