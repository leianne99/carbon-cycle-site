  <h1>🐾 Respiration</h1>

  <p><strong>Respiration</strong> is the process by which animals (including humans) and plants break down food molecules (like glucose) to release energy.</p>

  <h2>🐛 What Happens During Respiration:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Organisms eat plants or other animals to get food (glucose).</li>
    <li>Inside their cells, glucose reacts with oxygen.</li>
    <li>This reaction produces energy, water, and carbon dioxide (CO₂).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧪 The Formula:</h2>
  <p>
    C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy  
    <br><em>(Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy)</em>
  </p>

  <h2>🌬️ Why It Matters:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Releases CO₂ back into the atmosphere (keeps the carbon cycle going)</li>
    <li>Supplies energy for movement, growth, and survival</li>
    <li>Occurs in all living things — plants do it too!</li>
  </ul>
